 <h3>If my marks are less than the previous marks in any subject after repeating, will my marks decrease?</h3>
    <p>No. Marks are never decreased when you improve any subject in Board. For example, if you already got 170 marks (1st Year 90 + 2nd Year 80) in Chemistry and you repeat it. After repeating, you get 160 marks (1st Year 75 + 2nd Year 85). Here, your old marks (170) will be shown in the final result card. A student is never at loss while improving any subject. 
            </p> </article>

        <h3>If I repeat complete 1st year or complete 2nd year, do I have to give my practicals again?</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p>No. Practicals are re-conducted only if you repeat a complete subject (1st Year + 2nd Year).</p>
        <h3>I want to improve my Intermediate marks. Can I repeat only Physics and Chemistry of 1st Year?  
            </h3>
            <p>
                

You cannot repeat the subjects of 1st year only. If you choose to improve any subject, you’ll have to take the examination of 1st Year and 2nd Year both. According to Punjab Board Policy, You can repeat:

Complete Intermediate
Complete 1st Year
Complete 2nd Year
Any Subject(s) of 1st Year + 2nd Year


            </p>
            <h3>
                    What is the Scope of any Degree Program?
            </h3>
<p>
        Just DO whatever you want to! Don't worry about the scope. Choose a program in which you're interested in. YOU WILL DECIDE THE SCOPE, NOT YOUR DEGREE (Scope Student ka hota hai, Degree ka nahi). There are job/career opportunities after every degree program. Top students from each field become successful and get a bright future. You’re supposed to be in the top 20% in any field in order to succeed. Be the top class student of whichever field you choose and prove yourself. Simple is that.
